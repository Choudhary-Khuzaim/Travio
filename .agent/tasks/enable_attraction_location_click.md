# Task: Enable Location Click on Attraction Details

## Status
- [ ] Make the location map preview in `AttractionDetailsScreen` navigation interactive via `_openMap` <!-- id: 0 -->

## Context
The user wants the "location" element inside the "Top Attractions" details to be clickable and show the location. Currently, in `AttractionDetailsScreen`, there is a map preview container that displays a location icon but acts only as a static image. The screen already has an `_openMap` function connected to a small button. We will make the main map preview container clickable as well to improve UX.

## User Request
"ab isme jitny top attraction hy usme jo location add kya hy usko click kren to uski location show hy"
(In the top attractions, the location that is added, if clicked, should show its location.)
